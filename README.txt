This app is used to demo how pixels/scaled pixels/
density independent pixels affect the display.

It consists of 5 buttons and a textview.  1 button is
set to 250 pixel width, 1 to 250 dp (density independent
pixels) and one to 250 sp (scaled pixels).  The other
two buttons are set programmatically to 250dp and 250sp
width.  Pressing any of the buttons will causes the edit
text item at the bottom of the screen to display the actual
width of the button in pixels.

The app also has a menu item that shows the display
characteristics for the device it is running on.

Source code is online at bitcom at
https://github.com/bebop-001/DisplayInfoDemo.  Please
use it as you wish.  Attribution is appreciated.

The code is compiled so it should run on Android 2.3.3 
through Android 5.0 but has only been tested on Android 4.
